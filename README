Repository for TList, a data structure to store a list of trajectories (with time), and TIndex, an index to query TList

A trajectory is a sequence of points visited by a single person, of the following form:

S_1 T_1 ... S_n T_n, where S is a stop, T is the time associated with the stop and 2 <= n <= 8 (n being an even number)

All stops and times in a trajectory need to be encoded as integers for the structures to be able to read and store them


** Source tree organisation and folder description

	The most interesting ones:

	* /scripts/: Scripts that manage the index creation and querying process. They don't expect arguments.

	* /bin/: Executables. It contains:
		- codeToInt: Transforms a trajectory file containing stop names and timestamps into its encoded version (with ints)
		- createIndex: Creates a TList and TIndex from a sorted, encoded trajectory file and saves the structures into files
		- queryIndex: Loads TList and TIndex from files and allows querying them (to obtain accesibility measures)

	* /src/: All source files (.cpp) are here.

	The rest:

	* /build/: Object files (.o) product of compilation are stored here

	* /datasets/: Folder to put datasets to be processed in.

	* /include/: Header files (.h).

	* /lib/: The place to store libraries.

	* /queries/: Query files go here.
		A query file contains one or more lines, where each line is a single query.
		A query is composed of 4 integers: s,t,i,o with spaces between them, where
			- "s" is a stop id
			- "t" is the initial time (a discrete time point)
			- "i" is the amount of discrete time points that compose the query buffer (each time represents 5 minutes; then, i=12 means a query buffer of 1 hour)
			- "o" should be 1 for every query over real trajectories only. It is a flag to indicate that we're only interested in trajectories 
				that *start* in (s,t) -as opposed to the ones that *include* (s,t)-
		An independent resulting file is saved for every individual query in the /query_data/ folder.

	* /structures/: TList and TIndex binary files are stored here
