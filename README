Repository for TList, a data structure to store a list of trajectories (with time), and TIndex, an index to query TList

A trajectory is a sequence of points visited by a single person, of the following form:

S_1 T_1 ... S_n T_n, where S is a stop, T is the time associated with the stop and 2 <= n <= 8 (n being an even number)

All stops and times in a trajectory need to be encoded as integers for the structures to be able to read and store them.


This structure supports a particular temporal reachability query, defined as follows:
Given a stop S, a starting time instant T_i, and ending time instant T_e and a time range R, the query returns all stops that are reachable from S by following any trajectory that starts at S at any time within [T_i, T_e) and travelling at most R time instants. For every reachable stop, the query also return some statistical information such as number of trajectories that led to that stop, sum of temporal distance to the origin stop of the query, among others.


## Source tree organisation and folder description

	The most interesting ones:

	* /scripts/: Scripts that manage the index creation and querying process. They don't expect arguments.

	* /bin/: Executables. It contains:
		- build_stops_dictionary: Loads a file with information about stops (int id and coordinates), and builds a dictionary-of-sorts structure with it
		- codeToInt: Transforms a trajectory file containing stop names and timestamps into its encoded version (with ints)
		- createIndex: Creates a TList and TIndex from a sorted, encoded trajectory file and saves the structures into files
		- queryIndex: Loads TList and TIndex from files and allows querying them (to obtain accesibility measures)
		- calc_reachability: To compute transportation reachability measures

	* /src/: All source files (.cpp) are here.

	The rest:

	* /build/: Object files (.o) product of compilation are stored here

	* /datasets/: Folder to put datasets to be processed in.

	* /include/: Header files (.h).

	* /lib/: The place to store libraries.

	* /reach_queries/: Reachability query files go here.
		A query file contains one or more lines, where each line is a single query.
		A query is composed of 4 integers: s,r,t_s,t_e with spaces between them, where
			- "s" is a stop id
			- "r" is the amount of discrete time points that compose the query range (each time represents 5 minutes; then, i=12 means a query buffer of 1 hour)
			- "t_i" is the starting time (a discrete time point)		
			- "t_f" is the ending time
		An independent resulting file for every individual query is saved in query_results/reachability/<dataset>/<time_interval>/

	* /structures/: Stores all files necessary to load and reconstruct structures previously built and saved.
